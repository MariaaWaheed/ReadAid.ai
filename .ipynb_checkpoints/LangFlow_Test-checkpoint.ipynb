The existence of even larger black holes, each with a mass equal to 10 billion Suns, can be inferred from the energetic effects on gas swirling at extremely high velocities around the centre of NGC 3842 and NGC 4889, galaxies near the Milky Way.\\n For example, if a black hole is a member of a binary star system, matter flowing into it from its companion becomes intensely heated and then radiates X-rays copiously before entering the event horizon of the black hole and disappearing forever. One example of a black hole is can be found in Cygnus X-1, a binary X-ray system consisting of a blue supergiant and an invisible companion 14.8 times the mass of the Sun. Discovered in 1971 in the constellation Cygnus, this binary consists of a blue supergiant and an invisible companion 14.8 times the mass of the Sun that revolve about one another in a period of 5.6 days.\\n'}, {'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole', 'content': 'He correctly noted that such supermassive but non-radiating bodies might be detectable through their gravitational effects on nearby visible bodies.[8][13][14] Scholars of the time were initially excited by the proposal that giant but invisible \\'dark stars\\' might be hiding in plain view, but enthusiasm dampened when the wavelike nature of light became apparent in the early nineteenth century,[15] as if light were a wave rather than a particle, it was unclear what, if any, influence gravity would have on escaping light waves.[8][14]\\nThe modern theory of gravity, general relativity, discredits Michell\\'s notion of a light ray shooting directly from the surface of a supermassive star, being slowed down by the star\\'s gravity, stopping, and then free-falling back to the star\\'s surface.[16] Instead, spacetime itself is curved such that the geodesic light travels on never leaves the surface of the \"star\" (black hole).\\n Similarly, the total mass inside a sphere containing a black hole can be found by using the gravitational analog of Gauss\\'s law (through the ADM mass), far away from the black hole.[67] Likewise, the angular momentum (or spin) can be measured from far away using frame dragging by the gravitomagnetic field, through for example the Lense–Thirring effect.[68]\\nWhen an object falls into a black hole, any information about the shape of the object or distribution of charge on it is evenly distributed along the horizon of the black hole, and is lost to outside observers. However, in the late 1960s Roger Penrose[48] and Stephen Hawking used global techniques to prove that singularities appear generically.[49] For this work, Penrose received half of the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics, Hawking having died in 2018.[50] Based on observations in Greenwich and Toronto in the early 1970s, Cygnus X-1, a galactic X-ray source discovered in 1964, became the first astronomical object commonly accepted to be a black hole.[51][52]\\nWork by James Bardeen, Jacob Bekenstein, Carter, and Hawking in the early 1970s led to the formulation of black hole thermodynamics.[53] These laws describe the behaviour of a black hole in close analogy to the laws of thermodynamics by relating mass to energy, area to entropy, and surface gravity to temperature. For a rotating black hole, this effect is so strong near the event horizon that an object would have to move faster than the speed of light in the opposite direction to just stand still.[116]\\nThe ergosphere of a black hole is a volume bounded by the black hole\\'s event horizon and the ergosurface, which coincides with the event horizon at the poles but is at a much greater distance around the equator.[115]\\nObjects and radiation can escape normally from the ergosphere. For non-rotating (static) black holes the geometry of the event horizon is precisely spherical, while for rotating black holes the event horizon is oblate.[96][97][98]\\nSingularity\\nAt the centre of a black hole, as described by general relativity, may lie a gravitational singularity, a region where the spacetime curvature becomes infinite.[99] For a non-rotating black hole, this region takes the shape of a single point; for a rotating black hole it is smeared out to form a ring singularity that lies in the plane of rotation.[100]'}, {'url': 'https://science.nasa.gov/universe/black-holes/', 'content': 'Black holes are among the most mysterious and fascinating objects in the universe.

The resulting black hole that is left behind is referred to as a stellar mass black hole and its mass is of the order of a few times the mass of the sun.\\n In 2021, Daisy completed a PhD in plant physiology and also holds a Master's in Environmental Science, she is currently based in Nottingham, U.K.\\nCosmic radiation during spaceflight could increase risk of erectile dysfunction in astronauts\\nJames Webb Space Telescope finds water and methane in atmosphere of a 'warm Jupiter'\\nMeta Quest 3 only launched last month, but the Black Friday deals are here already\\nBy Fran RuizOctober 03, 2023\\n The inner region of a black hole, where the object's mass lies, is known as its singularity, the single point in space-time where the mass of the black hole is concentrated.\\n\"}]\u001b[0m\n"
